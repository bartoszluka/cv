            \section*{About}
            Hi, I'm Bartek, a \textbf{24-year-old} computer science student specializing in software development.
            I'm skilled in many programming languages such as C\#, TypeScript, Haskell, F\#, Python, C, Java, and want to learn more.
            I'm seeking a challenging role where I can apply my skills and learn from experienced professionals.
            I'm a dedicated problem solver and team player, always eager to take on new challenges and expand my skill set.

                I worked in a startup on a project, which focused on creating a mobile app that aggregated account information from many different banks.
                During my time at the company, I developed most of the mobile app,
                created the backend that connected to other banks’ APIs,
                configured a database, and set up CI/CD.\@

                During my studies, I learned a lot about programming, algorithms, databases, operating systems, and more.
                My time at university also taught me how to research on my own and how to work with others.
                I have completed several projects, including web applications (front-end and back-end), CLI tools, and a compiler.
                
                My most ambitious project was part of my thesis, which was a system for managing competition for the best thesis.
                It consisted of a web server (C\#, ASP.NET) for storing and managing submissions as well as user accounts,
                and a website (TypeScript, React) for the user interface.
            } 
            \section*{Activities}
            
            In my spare time, I like to work on my own projects, which include: a math library, a compiler, a web app, and a desktop GUI app.
            All of which are created with great attention to detail, so the final product is intuitive, reliable and safe.
            Every project is (or soon should be) open source and available on my GitHub account.
            
            I also enjoy spending time configuring my tools to improve and perfect my workflow and productivity.
